PROGRAMMING PATTERNS

1. Frequency counter - this pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values.
					   This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n2) operations with arrays or strings

2. Multiple pointers - Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move
					   towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition. Very efficient for
					   solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

3. Sliding window

4. Divide and Conquer

5. Dynamic programming

6. Greedy algorithms

7. Backtracking
