Sorting - process of arranging elements of unordered data structure in order

Types:
    BASIC:
    1. Bubble     - sorting that works in a way where biggest elements are pushed to the top of the structure.
                    Inefficient, avg time complexity O(n sq)
    2. Selection  - sorting that works in a way where smallest elements are swapped with the first element.
                    Inefficient, avg time complexity O(n sq)
    3. Insertion  - sorting that works in a way where last elements are inserted into the right place.
                    Inefficient, avg time complexity O(n sq)

    INTERMEDIATE:
    1. Merge      - sorting based on the fact that 0-1 element arrays are always sorted
