Recursion - a process, that calls itself, on a changing scale

Why?
    It's everywhere (JSON.parse / JSON.stringify)
    Object traversal algorithms
    Present in complex data structures
    Sometimes a cleaner approach, compared to iteration

How?
    1. Invoke the same function with a different input until the base case is reached
    2. The base case - where the recursion stops

Be careful of:
    1. Not having a base case
    2. Having wrong base case
    3. Infinite loop
    4. Not returning
    5. Returning wrong thing
