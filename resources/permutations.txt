permutations = all possible combinations of string
number of permutations of string with length of n is n! = 1 * ... * n

base case:
    1. if there's only one character left, we add string to permutations array
otherwise:
    2. for each character in the string:
        3.we swap it with the next one
        4. we call permute with the next character set as beginning (sort of locking the previous characters)
        5. swap back
